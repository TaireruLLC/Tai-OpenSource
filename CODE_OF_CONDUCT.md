**Version 1.0 – Crafted with Ethics, Laughter, and Love**

Welcome to the Tai-OpenSource community! Whether you’re contributing code, logging an issue, or just here for the dad jokes, we’re glad you stopped by. To keep this a safe, respectful, and collaborative space for everyone, we've laid out a few ground rules.

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

We’re building more than just software — we’re cultivating a culture. That means:

- 🤝 **Respect Comes First**  
  Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and dignity, regardless of background, identity, or experience.

- 💬 **Communicate Thoughtfully**  
  Speak clearly, constructively, and with empathy. Critique code, not people.

- 😂 **Keep It Light (When Appropriate)**  
  Tai thrives on humor — feel free to sprinkle in some lightheartedness! Just be mindful not to cross into sarcasm, ridicule, or disrespect.

- 🔐 **Protect Privacy & Security**  
  Do not share personal or confidential information about others without consent.

- 💡 **Assume Good Intentions, But Call Out Harm**  
  Mistakes happen. Offer guidance, not blame — and if something feels wrong, let’s talk it out.

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

To keep our ecosystem healthy, we **do not tolerate**:

- Harassment, bullying, or discriminatory remarks  
- Hate speech or derogatory language (even as a “joke”)  
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or collaboration  
- Sharing malicious code, exploits, or vulnerabilities  
- Spam, self-promotion, or unrelated advertising

## ✅ Contributor Expectations

If you’re submitting code, issues, or comments, please:

- Follow project guidelines and code formatting  
- Document your changes clearly and meaningfully  
- Write secure, ethical, and responsible code  
- Credit others’ work when relevant  
- Test before you push — Tai may be autonomous, but he loves a good QA buddy
